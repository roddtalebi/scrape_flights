# Scrape Flights from Kayak

Followed the methods from this [post](https://towardsdatascience.com/if-you-like-to-travel-let-python-help-you-scrape-the-best-fares-5a1f26213086) but adapted it to my own needs/wants.

Given a set of home + destination airport codes, this will scrape weekend flights for the next few weeks so that I can keep track of prices. 
I plan on using plotly to make interactive plots and host it on my own github.io page.

Still need to set up a cronjob to update...maybe even pull and push data so that I can be multiple computers doing the process on different days.
